BMI Calculator
Developed as part of internship at Oasis Infobyte

Project Overview
This is a console-based BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using Python. The project was completed as part of my Java Development Internship at Oasis Infobyte to practice input handling, functions, and basic logic building.

The program takes the user’s weight (kg) and height (m) as input, calculates the BMI, and classifies the result into standard categories like Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity.

Features
Calculates BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m)²)

Classifies the result as:

Underweight

Normal weight

Overweight

Obesity

Handles invalid inputs with proper error messages

Fully interactive console interface

How It Works
The user enters their weight in kilograms.

The user enters their height in meters.

The program calculates the BMI and displays both the BMI value and its category.

Technologies Used
Python programming language

Concepts of functions, conditionals, loops, and input validation

Learning Outcome
Practiced Python functions and modular programming

Learned to build interactive console applications

Applied mathematical formulas in programming
